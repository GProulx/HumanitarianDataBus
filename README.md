# Humanitarian Data Bus

 The purpose of this application is to provide a common interchange mechanism for disaster relief organizations. There's a large amount of data that different organizations collect during recovery and rebuild. This application will enable those different organizations to share that data. It will mean that everyone involved has better information, and therefore makes better decisions during the recovery and rebuild operations.
